# ***Don't Step On the Lines***
### **High Concept**
Have you ever heard the phrase "Step on a crack, break your mother's back. Step on a line, break you father's spine."
Don't Step On the Lines combines both a thrilling endless runner to a common wives-tale you've never seen in a game before.
You've never been this close to this myth coming to life before.

### **Story**
The game takes place in a world where mothers and fathers all over the world can have their backs and spines broken at any given moment.
You play as the child of unnamed parents, in a quest to get to school without breaking your parents bones.

### **Esthetics**
* The style of the game will be more cartoony, giving off a very ink like appearance. Colors will be bright and saturated. Animations will
also look more exaggerated.
* The sound will probably be a looped track playing in the background, as this is an endless runner. The music will be fast-beat, making it fit
the fast paced nature of the game.
* Sound effects will include jumping sounds for the player, death sound, and a background music track that will play during the main game.

### **Gameplay**
**Mechanics**
* The player moves either left or right, but always is moving forward at a constant speed. 
* Multiple levels of increasing difficulty.
* Each level has a time requirement that must be reached.
* Different shaped cracks and lines will appear on the screen that the player must dodge by either: jumping, moving left, or moving right.

**Controls**
* Keyboard and/or mouse
* Keyboard: "A" to move left, "D" to move right, and "SPACE" to jump
* Mouse: Move the mouse left or right to change direction, and "Left Click" to jump.

The game will feature increasingly harder levels. The beginning couple stages will act as the tutorial sections that introduce all types of
challeneges that the player will face.

Each player will need to learn the different patterns of cracks and lines that spawn each level. For example, there might be a crack on the ground
that is just a straight line across the entire screen, while another crack might look like a curve. One might be harder to dodge than the other.
They will also need to master the movement
mechanics, which will allow them to better avoid obstacles. Players must also be able to handle the increasing movement speed with each new level.
